        <div class="hobby-text">
           <p> For me football is my favorite hobby because it's part of my life and I cannot live without it and sometimes 
            I get my motivation through watching a football game when my team is losing but they comeback during the game to score more goals and win before at the last minute, then I feel like I can do it too and it's never too late.
            One of the things I learned from soccer, the game is not over till the whistle blows, meaning you must work hard and do not give up until the last moment. 
            Football is a combination of passion and emotion. The World Cup that recently took place in Qatar once proved again why it's considered the most popular and interesting sport.
            As until the last second of the match two significant national teams Argentina with Leo Messi and France with Kyllian Mbappe were struggling and attempting to win the World Cup.Consequently, Argentina won the tournament after decades since they had won before. </p>

        <div class="hobby-text">
            <p> My favorite is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C."  class="hobby-link" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer"> <i> Fc Liverpool </i></a>. I have been observing Liverpool matches since 2009. The first match that I watched was the game with Arsenal, which ended with 4:4 result, and that is the match that I will never forget. It's already been twelve years that I have been Liverpool fan. In these years I have watched my lovely team in huge decline, but they shined again in 2016 when the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%BCrgen_Klopp" class="hobby-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <i> Yurgen Klopp</i></a> started his Liverpool journey as a manager.
            We have won Champions League, English Premier League , and also a couple domeslic leagues for thesee years.
            Liverpool Football Club is a professional football club based in Liverpool, England. The club competes in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. Founded in 1892, the club joined the Football League the following year and has played its home games at Anfield since its formation.

            Domestically, the club has won 19 League titles, eight FA Cups, a record nine League Cups and 16 FA Community Shields. In international competitions, the club has won six European Cups, three UEFA Cups, four UEFA Super Cups—all English records—and one FIFA Club World Cup. The club established itself as a major force in domestic and European football in the 1970s and 1980s, when Bill Shankly, Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan and Kenny Dalglish, led the club to a combined 11 League titles and four European Cups. Liverpool won two further European Cups in 2005 and 2019 under the management of Rafael Benítez and Jürgen Klopp, respectively; the latter led Liverpool to a 19th League title in 2020, the club's first during the Premier League era.
            
            Liverpool is one of the most valuable and widely supported clubs in the world. The club has long-standing rivalries with Manchester United and Everton. Under management by Shankly, in 1964 the team changed from red shirts and white shorts to an all-red home strip which has been used ever since. The club's anthem is "You'll Never Walk Alone". </p>
